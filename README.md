# Collaborative DSA Learning Platform! üöÄ

## Overview üéØ

Welcome to the **Collaborative DSA Learning Platform**! This platform allows users to practice and learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) interactively. It provides an engaging and collaborative environment where users can solve problems, track their progress, and get personalized recommendations. 

### üåü Key Features:
- **User Authentication & Authorization**: Secure login and role-based access for users and admins.
- **Interactive Problem Solving**: Users can solve a wide range of DSA problems.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Get suggestions for problems based on your skills.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Solve problems together with peers in a shared environment.
- **Leaderboard**: Track your performance on a global leaderboard.
- **User Profile Management**: View and edit your personal details and progress.
- **üíª **Code Editor**: Seamless problem-solving using an integrated code editor to write and submit solutions.
- **üìö **Google Tech Dev Guide**: Access Google's official Tech Developer Guide for interview preparation.

## How the Project Works üõ†Ô∏è

The **Collaborative DSA Learning Platform** is built using **Spring Boot**, **MongoDB**, and **JWT Authentication**. Here's how it all fits together:

### 1. **User Authentication & Authorization** üîê
   - Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles. 
   - The platform uses **JWT** tokens for secure authentication. Each request to the backend is verified using a valid token. 
   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: There are roles for users and admins. Admins have access to all functionality, while regular users are restricted to their own profile and problem-solving areas. 

### 2. **Problem Solving** üíª
   - Users can browse and solve DSA problems of varying difficulty. 
   - Each problem is associated with specific **tags** (e.g., Arrays, Linked Lists) to help users focus on specific topics.
   - The solution submission feature allows users to submit their solutions, which are then evaluated and stored in their profile.

### 3. **üíª **Code Editor**: Seamless Problem Solving**
   - Integrated **Monaco Editor** enables real-time coding and problem-solving directly on the platform.
   - Users can write, edit, and submit solutions in the editor, making it easy to test and improve their code.
   - This editor provides a rich set of features such as syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and error checking to enhance the user experience.

### 4. **üìö **Google Tech Dev Guide**: Interview Preparation**
   - Access the **Google Tech Dev Guide** directly on the platform for an organized collection of topics, tutorials, and resources for Google interview preparation.
   - Users can navigate through the guide, learn key concepts, and get prepared for tech interviews with Google and other top companies.
   - It acts as a one-stop resource for all technical interview materials, boosting the chances of cracking the interviews.

### 5. **Leaderboard & Collaboration** üéÆ
   - The **Leaderboard** showcases the top users based on the number of problems solved and their performance.
   - Users can collaborate in solving problems, share solutions, and compete to be the top coder on the platform.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

This project leverages the following technologies:

- **Spring Boot**: The backend framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database to store user profiles, problems, and submissions.
- **JWT Authentication**: For secure login and session management.
- **Redis** (optional): For caching frequently accessed data.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application and ensuring it runs consistently across environments.
- **Swagger**: For API documentation and easy access to the list of endpoints.
- **Monaco Editor**: For real-time code editing and problem-solving.
- **Thymeleaf**: For rendering HTML templates (if you plan to use them).
- **JUnit**: For unit testing and ensuring the reliability of the codebase.
